Blog

Dev share talk on how to build a decoupled blog module. This is just a simplified example and it does not represent a production ready code.

I might add some more docs in the future, as well as expand the example.

Please also check the [magento](https://github.com/dpoposki/magento-blog.git) and [silex](https://github.com/dpoposki/silex-blog.git) modules which implement this module.
